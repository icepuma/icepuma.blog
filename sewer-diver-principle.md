Aloha,

I've been a freelancer for the last 3 years. I work for [Symbiolab](https://symbiolab.de/) as a developer doing all sorts of projects. I talk about some of my more recent projects and try to outline a principle, which I call `The Sewer Diver Principle`.

My aspiration doing freelance work is always to be responsible for all the things I code / maintain or contribute in a customers code base.
